# sportswarehouse.bigstevelittle.com

This is a site original built for the main project in my 'Diploma of Website Development' in 2021. The project had specific deliverables and time frames and so there are a number of issues and improvements still to work on.

Live website https://sportswarehouse.bigstevelittle.com.

## Major Additions

- [ ] CSS: individual item display.
- [ ] Consider converting css to sass.

## Fixes

- [ ] PHP security and code improvements (based on the 'Snyk Vulnerability Scanner' within VS Code).
- [ ] Page load movement issues when using clicking on home logo and menus.
- [ ] Administration: update an item issue where a new image must be uploaded even when there is no change to the image.
- [ ] Footer menus: improve list decorations.
- [ ] Apply a 'override' to the linguist language specification to identify all '.php' files as '.php' rather than 'hack' files.
